        <h1>ART GALLERY</h1>
        <h2>ABOUT US. </h2>
        <p>
            "People see owning a gallery as a way to get rich. I never thought that I could get rich in the art world. I wanted a life in art. I wanted to live with artists. I wanted to make beautiful shows."

            -Arne Glimcher, Gallery Owner

        </p>
        <p>
            rne Glimcher and I have a lot in common. We both understand that the art world is often perceived as a mysterious place, a distant universe, or a way to get rich. It has also been considered by many to be an exclusive and elitist society. However, with the innovation of technology, the internet, and the growth of international art fairs, much progress has been made in demystifying this wonderful and creative world and introducing its many players, including artists, museums, cultural institutions, media, curators, fairs, auction houses, and of course, art galleries. I have owned and directed my art gallery for 22 years. My position has provided me with a wealth of experience and professional insights to be able to explain the important role and purpose of a gallery within the art world.



            This article is dedicated to all those who told me and continue to say, "Your job is so wonderful. You make so much money promoting beautiful art to beautiful people." This is a wonderful perception - but there is so much more to the reality.





            I opened my art gallery after years of living and working in the world of art. I majored in Art History at Middlebury College in Vermont and began my career working at the Gold Museum in Bogota, Colombia. My career led me to formative positions in the same city, working with the Art Department at the Bank of the Republic, and the Museum of Modern Art, in the museology, curatorial and editorial departments, respectively. Breaking with tradition, I forged a path with a partner and launched an art consulting office in the late 80s and early 90s. It was a new concept in Colombia. In 2000, I went out on my own and opened Beatriz Esguerra Art.



            The primary purpose of an art gallery is to nurture visual artists, promote their work, and expose them to the public, collectors, media, and cultural institutions. Furthermore, the gallery works tirelessly and strategically to advance the artists' careers and establish them in the professional art world both locally and globally. To achieve this vast mission, a gallery must provide appropriate exhibition space, manage administrative and curatorial staff, provide insurance, secure advertising, invest and participate in a myriad of very expensive art fairs, develop and set up websites, pay for subscriptions, and produce timely and well-attended events. Each gallery represents and promotes a group of artists that, in general terms, follows a specific line and style; this makes each art gallery unique. For example, some galleries represent emerging artists, and others promote specific art genres such as abstract or contemporary art, art on paper, or the masters of the 20th century. Mistakenly, many think that any artist fits in any gallery without considering the vision, mission, and style promoted by the specific gallery.

                        <p class="title">CEO & Founder</p>
                </center>
                <p>
                    Human perception of the body is so acute and knowledgeable that the smallest hint of a body can trigger recognition.
                    —Jenny Saville
                    <br>
                    In her depictions of the human form, Jenny Saville transcends the boundaries of both classical figuration and modern abstraction.
                    Oil paint, applied in heavy layers, becomes as visceral as flesh itself, each painted mark maintaining a supple, mobile life of its own.
                    As Saville pushes, smears, and scrapes the pigment over her large-scale canvases, the distinctions between living, breathing bodies and their painted representations begin to collapse.

                    Born in 1970 in Cambridge, England, Saville attended the Glasgow School of Art from 1988 to 1992, spending a term at the University of Cincinnati in 1991.
                    Her studies focused her interest in “imperfections” of flesh, with all of its societal implications and taboos.She has spoken of seeing the work of Titian and
                    Tintoretto on trips with her uncle, and of observing the way that her piano teacher’s two breasts—squished together in her shirt—became one large mass.
                    While on a fellowship in Connecticut in 1994, Saville was able to observe a New York City plastic surgeon at work.
                    Studying the reconstruction of human flesh was formative in her perception of the body—its resilience, as well as its fragility.
                    Her time with the surgeon fueled her examination into the seemingly infinite ways that flesh is transformed and disfigured.
                    She explored medical pathologies; viewed cadavers in the morgue; examined animals and meat; studied classical and Renaissance sculpture;
                    and observed intertwined couples, mothers with their children, individuals whose bodies challenge gender dichotomies, and more.

                    <h2>Mark Bradford</h2>
                    <p class="title">Art Director</p>
            </center>
            <p>
                Mark Bradford (b. 1961 in Los Angeles; lives and works in Los Angeles) is a contemporary artist best known for his large-scale abstract paintings created out of paper. Characterized by its layered formal, material, and conceptual complexity, Bradford’s work explores social and political structures that objectify marginalized communities and the bodies of vulnerable populations. Just as essential to Bradford’s work is a social engagement practice through which he reframes objectifying societal structures by bringing contemporary art and ideas into communities with limited access to museums and cultural institutions.Drawing from the diverse cultural and geographic makeup of his southern Californian community, Bradford’s work is as informed by his personal background as a third-generation merchant there as it is by the tradition of abstract painting developed worldwide in the twentieth century. Bradford’s videos and map-like, multilayered paper collages refer not only to the organization of streets and buildings in downtown Los Angeles, but also to images of crowds, ranging from civil rights demonstrations of the 1960s to contemporary protests concerning immigration issues.

                Mark Bradford has received many awards, including the Bucksbaum Award (2006); the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award (2003); and the Joan Mitchell Foundation Award (2002). He has been included in major exhibitions at Los Angeles County Museum of Art (2006); Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2003); REDCAT, Los Angeles (2004); and the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York (2001).The Whitney Biennial (2006);Bradford lives and works in Los Angeles.

                “I just happened to paint words
                like someone else paints flowers.”

                Edward Ruscha

                Once, when asked about the abundance of text in his work, Ed Ruscha explained, “I just happened to paint words like someone else paints flowers.”1 Indeed, language remains the artist’s most consistent subject, one whose form and meaning he has continuously explored over more than six decades.

                In 1961, one year after completing his studies at the Chouinard Art Institute (now CalArts) in Los Angeles, where he had initially enrolled as a commercial art student, Ruscha spent several months traveling through Europe. For Zone, produced while he was in Paris, Ruscha placed a found scrap of paper, shaped vaguely like a US state, under the work’s evenly spaced title. It captures not only his interest in the collages of Kurt Schwitters, particularly the German artist’s use of discarded materials, but also the influence of his apprenticeship at a small press, where he learned to handset type, in 1958.
                Over the next couple of years, Ruscha fell in with the artists orbiting the Ferus Gallery, which opened in 1957 on La Cienega Boulevard in West Hollywood. Founded by the curator Walter Hopps, his wife Shirley Hopps, and the artist Edward Kienholz, Ferus quickly became the ground zero of Los Angeles art, hosting exhibitions by Kienholz and a roster of talents that included John Altoon, Larry Bell, Billy Al Bengston, Robert Irwin, John McCracken, and Ed Moses, as well as Ruscha. Stylistically they were a diverse lot whose efforts ranged across figuration, Expressionism and Minimalist abstraction and this was no less true of Ruscha’s output, which ran the gamut from Pop Art to conceptualism.
